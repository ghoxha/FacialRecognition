Problem: In this project, we will explore using face recognition in real-world scenarios, and recognize faces in real-time through a web-camera. The identity of the face is expected as the output of the system.

- However, questions have been raised on the effectiveness of face recognition software in cases of railway and airport security?

Proposed solutions:
(1) Use web-camera to record the videos.  
(2) Detect the faces in the videos
(3) Extract facial features from the images (LBP, SIFT, VGG-Face, etc.)
(4) Use the classifier (SVM, kNN, etc.) to find the identity

**Process chain: face detection -> feature extraction -> face recognition

Requirement:
(1)a Any state of the art work? 1(b)Is there any good library (Python, MATLAB, Java)? Please do a quick survey and list them.

1(a): State of the art technology: NEC Corp. is focusing on the development and spread of its facial recognition technology.  article 8.16.17 
NIST: Biometric and Facial Recognition Technology.  article 3/22/17

OpenCV is the most popular library for computer vision
1(b)- Libraries in 
	phython: openCv-python library
	matlab: openCv library
	java sdk plugins: opencv supports desktop java
	
(2) What are the limitations of the current solutions? How would you solve it?
	- Notwithstanding the tremendous effort to solve the face recognition problem, it is not possible yet to design a face recognition system with a potential close to human performance
	- Are Face Recognition Systems Accurate? MIT article 7/6/17
	
(3) Could you use both tracking and detection results to improve the quality of detected faces?
	- yes because with tracking a tracking framework is generated and the algorithm builds a history of face candidates. Then a set of possible paths are assigned to the detected faces that represents a possible trajectory.  then matches are calculated for the 2d dimensional simularities.  PDF Tracking and detection
	
(4) Can you make an end-to-end system including *user registration* and *intruderâ€™s recognition*?

 





*multiple face recognitions
	- detection: identifies a face
	- facial characterization: descerns teh demographic of a face
	- verificaiton purposes: access phones, laptops
